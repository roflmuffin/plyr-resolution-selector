# Plyr Resolution Selector
Adds a resolution selector control to the [Plyr](https://github.com/Selz/plyr/) HTML5 video player to allow users to switch between video qualities.

## Install
You can use bower (`bower install plyr-resolution-selector`), npm (`npm install plyr-resolution-selector`), or download the source from this repo. This plugin was built against version [1.8.2](https://github.com/Selz/plyr/blob/master/changelog.md) and is untested against previous versions.

## Usage
Add an extra attribute to your `<source>` elements.
```html
<video>
  <source res="480" src="..." type="..." />
  <source res="240" src="..." type="..." />
</video>
```

or in code, simply specify 'res' as an additional property of your video sources.
```js
player.source({
  type: 'video',
  title: 'Video Title',
  sources: [{
      src: '/path/to/movie.mp4',
      type: 'video/mp4',
      res: '480'
  },
  {
      src:    '/path/to/movie.mp4',
      type: 'video/mp4',
      res: '720'
  }]
});
```

Enable the plugin once the `Plyr` has been setup.

```js
var player = plyr.setup()[0]
PlyrResSelector.use(player)
```

By default, the `<select>` element will be inserted after the volume bar, but you can insert it after another control as such:

```js
PlyrResSelector.use(player, 'plyr__progress')
```
or even
```js
PlyrResSelector.use(player, '[data-plyr="mute"]')
```

## Styling the select
 The plugin does not include any styling apart from changing the font color & margin, so the select will appear in the browsers default style. The element has the classname `plyr__resolution` in a similar fashion to other Plyr control, so simply target this classname to restyle.
